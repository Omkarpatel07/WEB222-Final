They are typically the player who touches the second ball after the initial serve or receive, and their main objective is to create scoring opportunities for their teammates by setting the ball accurately and quickly.</p>

<li>Outside Hitter:</li><p>Also known as the left-side hitter, the outside hitter is responsible for attacking from the left front position of the court. They are usually the primary attackers and play a crucial role in scoring points for the team. Outside hitters need to have good hitting, blocking, and serving skills.</p>

<li>Middle Blocker:</li><p>The middle blocker, also known as the middle hitter or middle attacker, plays a critical role in both offense and defense. They are responsible for blocking the opponent's attacks at the net and attacking from the middle front position. Middle blockers need to have good blocking, hitting, and quick footwork skills.</p>

<li>Opposite Hitter:</li><p>The opposite hitter, also known as the right-side hitter, plays on the right front position of the court and complements the outside hitter. They are responsible for attacking from the right side and often serve as the team's secondary option for scoring points. Opposite hitters need to have good hitting, blocking, and serving skills.</p>

<li>Libero:</li><p>The libero is a specialized defensive player who wears a different colored jersey and has certain limitations on their offensive actions.

              <h2> To play this game, follow the given steps:</h2>
              
              <ul type = "square">
               <li><b>Gather a team:</b></li>

                <p>Form a team of players, usually consisting of six players on the court at a time. Make sure you have a designated captain or team leader to organize the team.
                
               <li><b>Set up the court:</b></li>

                <p>Mark out the boundaries of the volleyball court with lines or ropes. Set up the net at the center of the court, with the top of the net positioned at a specified height according to the age group and skill level of the players.
                
                <li><b>Serve:</b></li>

                <p>The game begins with a serve, where one player from the serving team hits the ball over the net into the opponent's court, aiming to land it within the boundaries of the opposing team's court.</p>
                
                <li><b>Rally:</b></li>

                <p>Once the ball is in play, both teams take turns hitting the ball over the net, trying to score points by making the ball touch the ground within the opponent's court or by forcing the opponent to make a mistake.</p>
                
                <li><b>Pass, set, attack:</b></li>

                <p>Teams use a combination of passing, setting, and attacking techniques to keep the ball in play and set up scoring opportunities. Players pass the ball to their teammates using forearm passes or overhead passes, set the ball using overhead hand passes, and attack the ball by spiking it over the net towards the opponent's court.</p>

                <li><b>Rotate positions:</b></li>

                <p>After each rally, teams rotate their positions in a clockwise direction to ensure that all players get an opportunity to serve and play in different positions on the court.</p>

                <li><b>Play to a specific point limit:</b></li>

                <p>In official volleyball games, teams usually play to a specific point limit, often 25 points, and must win by a minimum of two points. The team that reaches the point limit first and has a lead of at least two points wins the game.</p>

                <li><b>Follow rules and regulations:</b></li>

                <p>It's important to understand and follow the rules and regulations of volleyball, including rules related to ball handling, net violations, and player rotations, to ensure fair play and safety.</p>

                <li><b>Have fun and communicate:</b></li>

                <p>Volleyball is a fast-paced and dynamic team sport that requires good communication, teamwork, and sportsmanship. Remember to have fun, encourage your teammates, and communicate effectively to improve your game and enjoy the experience.</p>
